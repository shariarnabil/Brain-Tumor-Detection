# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-MRI-Images-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision

Overview

This project implements a deep learning model for detecting brain tumors in MRI images using computer vision techniques. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify MRI scans as tumor-positive or tumor-negative.

Features





Preprocesses MRI images for model input



Uses a CNN model for tumor detection



Evaluates model performance with accuracy metrics



Supports training and inference on custom datasets

Requirements





Python 3.8+



TensorFlow/Keras



OpenCV



NumPy



Matplotlib



scikit-learn
